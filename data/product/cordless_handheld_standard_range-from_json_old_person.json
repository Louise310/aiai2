You can choose what’s easiest.\n- Auto‑host cables help it set itself up when you plug it in.\n\nWhere it fits:\n- Great for home use, small shops, church offices, community centers, and front desks.\n- Built for everyday needs in retail and hospitality, but simple enough for anyone.\n\nWhat’s in the box:\n- Handheld scanner (black)\n- Presentation cradle (stand)\n- USB cable\n- Quick start setup\n\nPlain‑language setup:\n1) If you want simple plug‑in use: connect the USB cable to your computer and the scanner. It should work right away.  \n2) If you want cordless: insert 3 AAA batteries, place the scanner in the cradle to pair, then start scanning.\n\nFriendly reminders:\n- The scanner beeps or shows a light when it reads a barcode—no need to press hard or hold very still.\n- You can hold it close to the barcode for best results.\n- If you’re not sure what to do, just plug in the USB cable and try a test scan.\n\nZEBRA makes sturdy, dependable equipment.
