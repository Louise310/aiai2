Focus on extracting the features and characteristics in data form, without flavor text or prose.\n\n---\n\nTitle: ZUZUAN 2 Piece Hammer Set,includes 1 Pack 8 OZ Mini Stubby Claw Hammer and 1 Pack 16 OZ Fiberglass General Purpose Claw Hammer,Soft Nonslip Handle & Heat Treated Head,Heavier for Higher Hardness\n\nDescription: 🔨【High Quality Hammer Head】 Forged from the finest high carbon steel and underwent heat treatment for superior durability, strength and toughness. Finely polished finish with rust-preventative clear coating insures sturdiness and longevity.\n\n🔨【Ergonomically Designed Handle】 Made of soft and non-slip rubber with TPR material coated, the curved design and textured surface provides exceptional comfort and strong grip, meanwhile the fiberglass construction absorbs vibration and reduces fatigue.\n\n🔨【Glue Feed Technology】 Adopts glue feed technology to glue the hammer head with the handle more firmly than the generally glued hammers, ensuring it won’t break off at the head or the handle come off. It will not drop, so it’s safe to use.\n\n🔨【Excellent Performance】Driving and pulling nails. The narrow, flat side of the hammerhead concentrates all force in a small area, generating maximum striking strength. While the sharpened and curved claw ends generate maximum nail-pulling leverage by using the lever principle.\n\n🔨【Handy and Compact】Its well-balanced weight and robust design allows for easy handling and convenient operation. Features a hang hole for convenient storage. Two sizes hammers will meet all your needs for all hammering and clawing applications.\n\n\n›  See more product details"
