Each has 130 cards (260 total).\n- The kids’ cards use familiar words with just two “do-not-say” words. The adult cards have varied words and “do-not-say” words that may change.\n\nHow to play (easy steps):\n1) Split into two teams. Put kids mostly on one team and adults on the other, or mix if you like.\n2) On your turn, draw a card. Try to make your team guess the main word.\n3) Do not say the “forbidden” (do-not-say) words on the card.\n4) A teammate uses the 1‑minute timer to keep track of time.\n5) If someone says a forbidden word, the other team squeaks the squeaker and gets a point.\n6) When the timer ends, count the points. The team with the most points wins.\n\nWhat’s in the box:\n- 2 decks of cards (one for kids, one for adults), 260 cards total.\n- 1 squeaker.\n- 1 one‑minute timer.\n\nWhy seniors may enjoy it:\n- Simple rules and short turns (just one minute).\n- Kids’ deck is easier; use it if you want a gentler challenge.\n- Big laughs and quick rounds—great for family visits and holidays.\n- No long setup; start playing in a few minutes.\n\nHelpful tips:\n- Keep reading glasses nearby if you use them.\n- Sit at a table with good light.\n- If timing feels too fast, agree to two minutes per turn.\n- Mix teams so everyone gets a chance to help.\n\nGoal:\n- Have fun and collect the most points by giving good clues—without saying those forbidden words.\n\nFrom Hasbro Gaming. Easy to learn, quick to play, and perfect for grandparents, parents, and kids to enjoy together.",
