  "descriptions": "Redragon K617 Fizz 60% Wired RGB Gaming Keyboard\n\nSimple to use. Comfortable to type. Easy on the eyes.\n\n- What it is: A small, tidy keyboard with 61 keys. It plugs in with a cable, so you don’t have to worry about batteries or charging.\n- Easy to see: Gentle, colorful backlights under the keys help you see letters in dim rooms. You can make the lights brighter or softer, and you can choose from many light styles. If you prefer no lights, you can turn them off.\n- Comfortable typing: The keys are “quiet mechanical,” which means they feel soft and smooth when pressed and make less noise than older clicky keyboards. They are built to last for many years of use.\n- Compact size: Because it is smaller than a full keyboard, it leaves more room on your desk for your mouse or notepad. It’s light and easy to move.\n- Ready to go: Just plug the cable into your computer, and it works. No batteries. No complicated setup.\n- Change if you want: The key switches can be swapped by hand if one wears out, without special tools. This is optional—you can simply use it as is.\n- Optional software: If someone helps you install the Redragon program, you can change what some keys do or set up simple shortcuts. This is not required to use the keyboard.\n\nWho will like it:\n- Anyone who wants a reliable, quiet keyboard that is easy to see and simple to plug in.\n- Great for small desks and tidy work areas.\n- Also popular with game players, but it’s perfectly fine for everyday typing, email, and browsing.\n\nIn short: A sturdy, quiet, plug‑in keyboard that’s easy to see and easy to use, with gentle lights and a space‑saving design. Plug it in and start typing.",
