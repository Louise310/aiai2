  "abstract": "Title: Stochastic Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammars\n\nAbstract:\nThis paper addresses stochastic extensions to Lexicalized Tree-Adjoining Grammars (LTAGs), a formalism that combines strong lexicalization with mildly context-sensitive generative capacity. We explore probabilistic parameterizations over LTAG derivations, focusing on how lexicalization interacts with structural dependencies to enable robust statistical parsing. The work considers probability models over elementary tree selection, adjunction, and substitution operations, and discusses constraints for ensuring well-formed derivations and tractable inference. We outline scoring functions l(b, 7, i, j, k, I) associated with derivational configurations, reflecting local decisions over spans and indices that arise during parsing. The approach emphasizes handling long-distance dependencies and capturing syntactic flexibility through anchored trees, while leveraging stochasticity to disambiguate among competing derivations. We present considerations for training such models from annotated data, addressing issues of parameter sparsity, lexical coverage, and independence assumptions. Finally, we discuss potential parsing strategies that exploit dynamic programming over tree-structured derivations, and we highlight the trade-offs between expressivity and computational efficiency inherent in stochastic LTAG frameworks.",
