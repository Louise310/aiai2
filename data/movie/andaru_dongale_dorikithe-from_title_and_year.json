  "descriptions": "Andaru Dongale Dorikithe (literally “Everyone Gets Caught as Thieves”) is a Telugu caper-comedy built around mistaken identities, double-crosses, and a treasure hunt gone awry. A motley group of small-time crooks, hustlers, and unsuspecting innocents converge on a coastal town after rumors spread about a hidden stash—cash, jewels, or a priceless artifact tied to a long-ago heist. Each character arrives with a scam, a disguise, or a half-baked plan, convinced they’re the smartest in the room.\n\nA fast-talking conman teams up with a streetwise auto driver and a hapless friend, while a sharp-tongued woman with her own agenda shadows them. Meanwhile, a bumbling cop eager for a big collar, a swaggering local don, and a slippery fence all keep tabs on one another. Their schemes collide at weddings, lodges, and docks, triggering a chain of comic misunderstandings—swapped bags, fake kidnappings, and midnight chases. As alliances shift, everyone pretends to be someone else, until the town itself turns into a stage where thieves hunt thieves.\n\nClues point to an abandoned bungalow where the loot is supposedly hidden, leading to a chaotic showdown. Just when one group thinks they’ve outfoxed the rest, another twist reveals they’ve been outplayed. In the end, masks drop: the “innocents” aren’t so innocent, the “criminals” have flashes of conscience, and everyone who tried to steal something ends up getting caught—by fate, by each other, or by the law. The treasure’s fate offers a wry punchline, wrapping the caper with a blend of satire, romance, and madcap fun.",
