  "descriptions": "A polished Manhattan art-dealing couple, Ouisa and Flan Kittredge, are preparing to close a lucrative sale when their evening is interrupted by a charming, wounded young man named Paul. Claiming he is a friend of their children and the son of actor Sidney Poitier, Paul dazzles them with intellect, gourmet cooking, and an effortless command of cultural references. Enchanted, the Kittredges offer him hospitality and introduce him to their elite circle. But Paul’s story begins to unravel after a startling incident reveals he is a con artist adept at mirroring the desires and prejudices of his targets.\n\nAs Ouisa and Flan discover that several friends have been similarly duped, they trace Paul’s path through a constellation of New Yorkers—wealthy patrons, aspiring actors, and disaffected students—each connected by brief encounters and mutual acquaintances. Paul’s ability to forge intimacy exposes the fragility of their identities and the transactional nature of their relationships. Ouisa, in particular, is shaken; she is both repelled by Paul’s deception and moved by his longing for belonging and reinvention.\n\nThe couple wrestles with how to respond: as victims seeking justice, or as people confronted with a human being whose lies were a plea to be seen. Six Degrees of Separation explores the thin membranes between classes, the allure of performance in modern life, and the idea that everyone is only a few connections apart—yet still profoundly isolated. In the end, Ouisa’s newfound self-awareness threatens the smooth surface of her privileged world.",
