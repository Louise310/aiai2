  "descriptions": "Sarah, a young woman who recently lost her sight in a riding accident, returns to the rural English estate of her aunt and uncle in hopes of regaining independence. Determined to prove she can navigate life without help, she memorizes the home’s layout and follows a careful routine. One afternoon, after spending time with her boyfriend, she comes back to the house unaware that a brutal killer has already visited. Moving through familiar rooms, she fails to notice the bodies of her family or the small clues of calamity around her—subtle disarray, a misplaced object, a lingering odor—while the audience sees what she cannot. \n\nAs night falls, Sarah’s isolation tightens. The killer, an elusive drifter marked only by a distinctive pair of boots, realizes she is blind and begins stalking the property. With the phone lines down and neighbors distant, Sarah must rely on her heightened senses and memory to survive. She turns the house’s layout to her advantage, using silence, touch, and the rhythm of sounds—dripping taps, creaking boards, distant horses—to evade her pursuer.\n\nTension escalates when Sarah discovers evidence of the murders and grasps the horror she’s been moving through. A small circle of friends and local authorities piece together the killer’s identity from the scant clues he leaves behind, including those telltale boots. In a final confrontation that merges panic with ingenuity, Sarah leverages her knowledge of the grounds and a sudden shift in weather to outmaneuver the attacker. See No Evil is a taut British thriller about vulnerability turned to strength, placing the audience inside the terror and resilience of a woman forced to navigate a nightmare without sight.",
