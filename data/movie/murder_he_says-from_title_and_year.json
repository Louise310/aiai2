  "descriptions": "Set in rural America during the waning days of World War II, Murder, He Says follows Pete Marshall, a mild-mannered pollster who wanders into an isolated backwoods community while searching for a missing colleague. He stumbles upon the sinister, eccentric Fleagle clan, a family notorious in the region for their violent tempers, feuds, and rumored connection to a hidden cache of stolen bank money. \n\nPete quickly realizes he’s in over his head as the family—dominated by the domineering matriarch Mamie and a pair of hulking, dim-witted twins—suspects he knows more than he lets on. Their late relative Bonnie supposedly left a cryptic, dying clue to the location of the loot, and the Fleagles are determined to extract it by any means necessary. Pete’s attempts to play along turn into a frantic masquerade, as he adopts fake identities, dodges deadly hospitality, and tries to decode a nonsensical-sounding rhyme that might be the key to the treasure.\n\nComplications multiply with the arrival of an impostor posing as Bonnie and the appearance of a plucky young woman with her own stake in the mystery. As bodies pile up and the household’s bizarre routines grow more menacing, Pete must rely on quick wit and harebrained improvisation to survive. The tension is undercut by farcical set pieces—glowing paint, booby-trapped dinners, perilous barn chases—that keep the tone buoyant even as the stakes rise.\n\nIn the end, Pete pieces together the riddle, exposing the family’s schemes and unmasking the true villains behind the disappearances and murders. With the help of his ally, he outmaneuvers the Fleagles, recovers the hidden money, and clears the mystery of his missing coworker. A comic blend of small-town noir and slapstick, Murder, He Says turns a murderous treasure hunt into a gleefully macabre romp, balancing suspense with screwball ingenuity.",
