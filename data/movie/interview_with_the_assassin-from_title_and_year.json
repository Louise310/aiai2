  "descriptions": "A struggling documentary filmmaker, Ron Kobeleski, meets his quiet suburban neighbor, Walter Ohlinger, who claims he was the second gunman in the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. Enticed by the scoop of a lifetime, Ron begins filming Walter’s confession, capturing his rambling recollections, cryptic details, and startling certainty. Walter says he was a Marine sharpshooter recruited by shadowy handlers, stationed behind the grassy knoll, and responsible for the fatal headshot. He offers fragments of evidence and leads: a hidden stash, names half-remembered, and a pattern of coincidences that point to a conspiracy.\n\nAs Ron follows Walter across the country to meet contacts, revisit sites, and verify the tale, his project turns from curiosity to obsession. The line between truth and performance blurs; Walter’s story is alternately persuasive and riddled with inconsistencies. Tension builds as strangers tail them, meetings end abruptly, and violence circles their investigation. Ron’s girlfriend worries about his safety and sanity, but the potential to rewrite history keeps him hooked.\n\nThe film-within-a-film aesthetic underscores shifting power: is Walter manipulating Ron, or is Ron exploiting Walter? Each revelation deepens the ambiguity, suggesting both a plausible conspiracy and an elaborate delusion. The journey culminates in a dangerous rendezvous meant to reveal definitive proof, only to spiral into paranoia and bloodshed. In the end, the documentary’s raw footage becomes a record not just of an alleged assassin’s confession, but of the corrosive pull of conspiracy, the hunger for truth, and the cost of believing the story you most want to be real.",
