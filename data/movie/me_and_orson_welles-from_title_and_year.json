  "descriptions": "Set in 1937 New York, Me and Orson Welles follows Richard Samuels, a charismatic, theater-struck high school student who stumbles into a life-changing week with the Mercury Theatre. By luck and bravado, Richard lands a small role in Orson Welles’s audacious, modern-dress production of Julius Caesar, staged at the Mercury’s cramped, electric headquarters. The intoxicating world of rehearsal rooms, smoky back hallways, and backstage politics draws Richard into Welles’s orbit, where genius and ego burn equally bright.\n\nWelles, brilliant, mercurial, and manipulative, orchestrates every detail—rewrites, lighting, music—while bulldozing obstacles and people with dazzling charm. Richard is dazzled too, and further ensnared by Sonja Jones, a sharp, ambitious production assistant whose aspirations mirror the ruthless pragmatism of show business. As opening night approaches, Richard experiences the thrills of artistic creation and the bruises of adult compromise: friendships fray, romantic illusions crack, and the cost of proximity to greatness becomes painfully clear.\n\nThe film builds to the Mercury’s landmark Caesar premiere, a triumph that cements Welles’s legend. For Richard, however, the success is double-edged. After a misstep and Welles’s characteristic wrath, he’s abruptly cast out, forced to reckon with what he’s learned about art, life, and himself. Returning to his own modest world, Richard carries a bittersweet wisdom: that brushes with brilliance can be transformative yet temporary, and that the stage—like youth—belongs as much to those who keep going after the curtain falls. The story blends coming-of-age warmth with a wry portrait of Welles’s theatrical reign, celebrating the messy, exhilarating birth of an artist’s identity.",
