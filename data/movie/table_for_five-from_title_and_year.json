  "descriptions": "Table for Five (1983) is a character-driven drama about a flawed father trying to reconnect with his three children during a Mediterranean vacation that quickly turns into an emotional reckoning. J.P. Tannen, a charming but unreliable drifter whose career and romantic misadventures have kept him distant, persuades his ex-wife Kathleen to let him take their kids—Tracy, Christopher, and little Tilde—on a cruise, promising a fresh start and quality time. He envisions a grand gesture: a literal table for five at dinners aboard ship, symbolizing his effort to be present, consistent, and in charge.\n\nFrom the outset, Tannen’s good intentions collide with his lack of parenting skill. Tracy, the teenager, is guarded and skeptical, forced too often into a surrogate adult role. Christopher, quiet and sensitive, craves direction but is wary of disappointment. Tilde, the youngest, is openhearted and eager for her father’s affection. Tannen fumbles with rules, bedtimes, and boundaries, resorting to charm and improvisation where structure is needed. Their daily excursions across sunlit ports—Rome, Athens, North Africa—become stages for small victories and larger missteps, as Tannen tries to bond through shared adventures while glossing over deeper issues.\n\nMidway through the trip, a life-altering phone call shatters the fragile détente: Kathleen has died suddenly. The news detonates the family’s equilibrium. Grief surfaces differently in each child—Tracy’s anger hardens, Christopher withdraws, Tilde clings—while Tannen’s guilt and panic surge. The holiday becomes a journey of mourning and a battle over the children’s future. Mitchell, Kathleen’s new husband, responsible and stable, wants to adopt the kids, arguing that he can provide the continuity and care they need. Tannen, awakened by loss and the looming threat of permanent separation, insists he can step up at last.\n\nWhat follows is a series of raw confrontations and quiet, intimate moments. Tannen learns to apologize without excuses, to enforce limits gently but firmly, and to listen rather than perform. He navigates the bureaucratic tangle of custody, the awkward logistics of funerals and flights, and the invisible weight of his children’s fear that they will be uprooted again. The cruise’s glittering veneer fades into the reality of cramped cabins, late-night tears, and unanswered questions about the past: why he left, why he couldn’t stay, whether love is enough when reliability has been absent.\n\nThe “table for five” motif recurs as both aspiration and measure. When they manage to sit together—through seasickness, missed connections, and temper flare-ups—Tannen strives to make each child feel seen. A spilled drink becomes a lesson in patience. A missed excursion turns into an impromptu card game where the rules matter because someone finally enforces them. Tannen’s romantic entanglements, once his refuge, are set aside as he confronts the mundane demands of parenthood: packing lunches, soothing nightmares, admitting fault.\n\nIn the end, there is no neat victory. The custody question reaches a bittersweet resolution that acknowledges Mitchell’s steadiness and the children’s need for security while leaving open a path for Tannen’s continued presence. The film closes on an earned, tentative hope: a father who has learned that love is a practice, not a promise, and children who begin to trust that he might keep showing up. Table for Five becomes a meditation on second chances, the cost of absence, and the quiet heroism of everyday commitment.",
