  "descriptions": "In the remote Namib Desert in 2003, a team of miners disappears under mysterious circumstances after uncovering a strange set of fossils. An international research crew is dispatched to investigate, including a pragmatic scientist, a skeptical logistics expert, and a local guide wary of desert legends. They soon discover the victims’ bones arranged in eerie patterns, as if something collected them.\n\nStranded when their vehicles fail and communications cut out, the team realizes they are being stalked by a shape-shifting entity composed of living ants that swarm around skeletal remains, using them as an exoskeleton to form a towering, humanoid “bone snatcher.” Drawn to sound and movement, the creature hunts relentlessly, dismantling its prey to add to its growing frame. As the desert heat and isolation wear down their resolve, group tensions flare, and well-intended plans turn into desperate gambits.\n\nThe survivors piece together that the ants’ hive is anchored to a rare, viscous resin beneath the sands—a natural adhesive that binds bones and grants the swarm cohesion. With dwindling supplies and nightfall approaching, they gamble on fire and improvised explosives to destroy the resin source. The plan forces them into the creature’s lair, where they must choose between rescuing a trapped teammate and ensuring the hive’s destruction.\n\nIn a fiery climax, the resin pit erupts, scattering the ants and toppling the bone construct. The survivors escape into the blazing dawn, uncertain whether they’ve truly eradicated the hive—or merely delayed the desert’s patient, predatory collector.",
