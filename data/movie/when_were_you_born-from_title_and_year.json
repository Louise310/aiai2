  "descriptions": "When Were You Born (1938) is a murder mystery with an astrological twist. The story centers on Mei Lei Ming, a poised Chinese astrologer whose uncanny chart readings unsettle skeptics and fascinate the curious. After she warns a brash broker that danger looms in his immediate future, he is found dead under suspicious circumstances aboard a San Francisco-bound ship. Police, quick to dismiss astrology, are baffled by the closed-circle nature of the suspects—fellow passengers and business associates whose motives range from financial desperation to jealousy and revenge.\n\nMei Lei Ming steps into the investigation, not as a medium but as a meticulous observer who uses birth dates, planetary positions, and character reading to draw out contradictions and hidden relationships others miss. Working alongside a wary reporter and a skeptical detective, she uses her charts to anticipate suspects’ behaviors: who will lie under pressure, who masks fear with bravado, who is likely to strike again. Each suspect embodies a zodiac sign’s traits in subtle ways—impulsiveness, secrecy, vanity, or stubborn loyalty—providing both red herring and revelation.\n\nAs more clues surface—coded messages, falsified documents, and a mysterious key tied to a risky stock scheme—it becomes clear the victim’s death is part of a larger swindle. A second attempted killing raises the stakes and seems to validate Mei’s earlier warning that the killer’s pattern is written in timing as much as motive. The reporter, initially out to debunk her, becomes a cautious ally when her predictions start aligning with hard evidence, such as the exact window in which the shipboard crime could have happened and which passenger’s alibi collapses under the weight of the stars’ “timed” movements.\n\nMei never claims supernatural power; instead, she frames astrology as a psychological map that, combined with keen intuition and logic, can expose pressure points in people’s stories. She stages a clever trap based on an astrological transit that she knows the culprit will try to exploit—an expected “lucky hour” that the killer believes favors escape. In the tense finale, timed to a celestial moment Mei has forecast, the murderer is caught attempting to secure the last piece of incriminating evidence, revealing a motive rooted in financial ruin and fear of exposure.\n\nThe case closes with the police publicly crediting Mei’s aid, though not all are ready to concede astrology’s value. The reporter, now convinced of her method’s practical insight, pens a sympathetic piece, while Mei offers a final, modest reflection: the stars may not compel, but they can illuminate the choices people are likely to make. The film blends whodunit mechanics with period fascination for the zodiac, presenting a cool-headed heroine whose cultural acuity and unconventional toolkit bring clarity to a web of greed, deception, and fate.",
