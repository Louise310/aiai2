  "descriptions": "“’Til There Was You” (1997) is a romantic dramedy about two destined lovers whose lives intersect for years without their realizing it, exploring the idea that timing and personal growth are essential to true connection.\n\nGwen Moss is a wistful, commitment-wary ghostwriter who longs for a grand, transformative love but drifts through a series of unfulfilling relationships. Nick Dawkan is a polished, successful architect whose ambition and image-conscious life keep him emotionally guarded. Both carry wounds from their families: Gwen idolizes a fantasy of perfect love shaped by old movies and her parents’ failures, while Nick’s strained relationship with his father fuels his drive and detachment.\n\nTheir lives weave around a historic Los Angeles apartment complex, La Fortuna, a once-charming Art Deco landmark threatened by redevelopment. Gwen becomes involved in a grassroots fight to save the building, drawn to its stories and to the sense of community it represents. Nick, hired to spearhead the redevelopment, believes modernization will “improve” the city, even as the project puts him at odds with residents and his own uncertain values.\n\nAs they circle each other across years, the film stages near-misses and almost-encounters: childhood music lessons with the same teacher, overlapping social circles, and chance appearances at the same cafes and parties. Gwen’s closest confidante, a flamboyant former child star, urges her to abandon her romanticized ideals, while Nick’s fiancée embodies the polished future he thinks he wants. Through setbacks and small awakenings—career disappointments, family reckonings, and the moral fight over La Fortuna—both begin to dismantle their illusions.\n\nWhen the preservation battle exposes compromises in Nick’s project and reignites Gwen’s courage, they finally meet, recognizing in each other the flawed but genuine person behind their personas. The film culminates with the fate of La Fortuna mirroring their choice: preserve what matters, or surrender to expedience. Choosing authenticity, they allow themselves to fall in love not as the ideal versions they once chased, but as two people who finally arrived at the right time for one another.",
