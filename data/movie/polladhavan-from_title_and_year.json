  "descriptions": "Polladhavan (2007) is a gritty Tamil action drama that follows the turbulent transformation of an aimless young man into a determined fighter when his hard-won pride—and the symbol of his self-worth—is violently taken from him.\n\nPrabhu (Dhanush) is a carefree youth in North Chennai whose life lacks direction. He spends his days hanging out with friends, drawing frequent criticism from his father for being irresponsible and unemployed. After a heated confrontation at home, Prabhu resolves to change course. He pawns family jewelry, secretly buys a gleaming Bajaj Pulsar motorcycle, and soon lands a steady job at a mineral water company. The bike becomes more than transport: it’s his first real achievement, a badge of independence and respect. His confidence grows; he begins to win back his family’s trust and catches the eye of his neighbor Hema (Divya Spandana), with whom a tender romance slowly develops.\n\nBut the same streets he rides with pride are scarred by gang rivalries. Local drug mafias, led by Selvam (Kishore) and his volatile younger brother Ravi (Daniel Balaji), run a quiet but ruthless network. Though Selvam is a composed, calculating don who tries to keep business orderly and violence minimal, Ravi is impulsive and cruel, constantly picking fights and jeopardizing their operations. Prabhu’s path collides with theirs when his beloved bike is stolen in a brazen daylight theft. The police are indifferent, and the case goes nowhere. Determined, Prabhu tracks clues through the underbelly of the neighborhood, discovering how theft rings move bikes, strip them, and resell them—networks that intersect with the Selvam-Ravi syndicate.\n\nPrabhu’s pursuit leads him to a petty crook named Out (Karunas), who offers information for cash and drags Prabhu deeper into dangerous territory. During this hunt, Prabhu inadvertently disrupts a drug exchange connected to Ravi’s crew. His search also brings him face-to-face with a young man who knows the bike’s fate, sparking a chain reaction: Prabhu recovers the bike after a risky confrontation, but not without drawing the attention—and grudge—of Ravi. For Prabhu, retrieving the bike is a triumph; for Ravi, it’s an unforgivable insult.\n\nMeanwhile, a tense subplot unspools between the brothers. Selvam, who sees himself as a pragmatic leader trying to keep the police at bay, constantly reins in Ravi’s recklessness. He has a strained but affectionate bond with a woman in his life and a growing sense that the business is losing its balance. Ravi, resentful, wants to assert dominance. This sibling tension eventually intersects with Prabhu’s story when Ravi commits a murder in a sudden outburst and tries to frame Prabhu to deflect heat from their organization.\n\nThe framing upends Prabhu’s fragile stability. The police now consider him a suspect, and Hema’s family begins to fear for her future with him. Prabhu’s father, already distrustful of his son’s recent bravado and secretive movements, is devastated by the implication that Prabhu may be involved in crime. Backed into a corner, Prabhu refuses to break. He digs deeper, trying to expose the real culprits. In the process, he inadvertently earns Selvam’s attention. Selvam, after initially treating Prabhu as an irritant, recognizes the young man’s courage and clarity. He views the conflict with a colder logic: Prabhu is just a common boy dragged into their world by Ravi’s rashness.\n\nThe feud escalates when Ravi targets Prabhu’s friends and family to bait him. A tense confrontation follows at a market, where Prabhu stands his ground in a brutal street fight, revealing the steel beneath his formerly carefree exterior. Selvam, watching the fallout, begins to understand that the true destabilizing force is not the outsider but his own brother. He attempts to isolate Ravi and clean up the mess, but the criminal ecosystem, once disturbed, spirals.\n\nA turning point arrives when Prabhu’s father is injured in a scuffle brought to their doorstep. The event shatters the household. Prabhu, wracked with guilt yet fueled by rage, confronts Selvam directly, drawing a clear line: he never sought violence, but he will not be hunted. Selvam, who believes in measured retaliation, offers a tacit truce—provided Prabhu disappears from their affairs. Ravi, however, refuses to let go, engineering another ambush. During a night chase and brawl, the bike—Prabhu’s prized symbol—takes damage, a visual echo of his life under siege.\n\nThe final act unraveling hinges on loyalty and consequences. Selvam learns definitively that Ravi committed the earlier murder and has continued to escalate without regard for the syndicate’s survival.",
