  "descriptions": "Entomologist Remy Panos, a high school science teacher in New York City, finds herself at the center of a new wave of strange killings when several men she briefly dated turn up dead, their faces grotesquely mutilated. Detective Klaski, a weary cop with little patience for the bizarre, investigates and discovers an unsettling link: each victim had encountered Remy shortly before being murdered. Clues suggest a nonhuman perpetrator—one that studies, imitates, and selectively hunts.\n\nYears after the original “Judas breed” cockroaches were supposedly eradicated, a surviving mutant has evolved further. Capable of mimicking human appearance and behavior even more convincingly, it fixates on Remy, displaying a disturbing, almost courtship-like pattern as it eliminates rivals and stalks her through subways, rooftops, and the shadowed corridors of her school. As bodies mount and suspicion tightens around her, Remy realizes the creature isn’t simply killing—it’s learning from her, communicating in cryptic ways, and attempting to choose her as a mate.\n\nTrapped overnight in the school with Klaski and a handful of potential victims, Remy uses her insect expertise to anticipate the predator’s tactics. The pursuit culminates in a claustrophobic showdown that forces her to confront both the ethics of engineered species and the tenacity of evolution in urban ecosystems. In the end, the creature’s fixation becomes its undoing, but the experience leaves Remy—and the city—haunted by the possibility that nature’s failed experiments never truly vanish; they adapt, hide in plain sight, and wait for the next opportunity.",
