  "title": "The Journey of Jared Price",
  "descriptions": "Fresh out of high school and eager to escape small-town constraints, 19-year-old Jared Price heads to Los Angeles with little more than a bus ticket and big dreams. Quickly confronted with the city’s harsh realities, he finds temporary refuge in a youth hostel and then secures live-in work as a personal assistant to Mrs. Haines, a wealthy, demanding, and eccentric older woman confined largely to her apartment. The job offers a bed and stability, but it also traps Jared in a gilded cage, testing his patience and sense of self.\n\nWhile running errands for Mrs. Haines, Jared meets Matthew, an attractive and more experienced gay man who introduces him to a world of possibilities—romance, independence, and an identity Jared has only tentatively explored. Drawn to Matthew yet bound by obligation to Mrs. Haines, Jared struggles with conflicting loyalties and the fear of disappointing those who rely on him.\n\nAs the relationship with Matthew deepens, Jared faces an ethical crossroads when Mrs. Haines’s manipulative streak intensifies and an opportunistic coworker eyes Jared’s position. The tension forces Jared to confront the compromises he’s making to survive. Ultimately, he must decide whether to maintain the security of his job—keeping his true self muted—or risk everything to claim the life he wants.\n\nThe Journey of Jared Price is a coming-of-age drama about first love, economic vulnerability, and the courage it takes to define oneself in a city that can be both indifferent and intoxicating. Jared’s path is neither linear nor easy, but through heartbreak, small triumphs, and painful honesty, he discovers that independence requires not only escape from the past, but also the conviction to choose a future on his own terms.",
