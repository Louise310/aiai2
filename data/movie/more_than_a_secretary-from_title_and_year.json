  "descriptions": "More Than a Secretary (1936) is a screwball romantic comedy set in bustling New York publishing. Carol Baldwin, a poised and efficient secretary who co-runs a stenography school, takes a job placement to demonstrate her students’ value. She lands in the chaotic office of Fred Gilbert, a driven but absent-minded editor of a men’s health and fitness magazine whose desk is a disaster and whose personal habits are worse. Determined to whip his office into shape, Carol cleans files, streamlines schedules, and quietly rewrites clunky copy to help the magazine shine—without taking credit.\n\nFred, initially oblivious to Carol’s talents beyond typing speed, begins to depend on her competence while courting a glamorous but shallow socialite who is drawn to his rising prestige. As Carol becomes indispensable, she finds herself both frustrated by Fred’s lack of awareness and unexpectedly charmed by his boyish single-mindedness. Complications mount when Carol’s improvements earn the magazine sudden success, bringing Fred attention he misattributes to his own methods, and when a well-meaning friend pushes Carol toward a more socially suitable suitor.\n\nA cascade of misunderstandings follows: office gossip, a botched dinner, and a jealous mix-up that sees Carol quitting in wounded pride. Deprived of her steadying presence, Fred’s world collapses into missed deadlines and editorial blunders. Realizing that Carol has been the true heart and brain behind his recent triumphs—and that he’s fallen for her spirit as much as her skill—Fred chases her down, determined to prove he sees her as more than a secretary.\n\nThe film ends with reconciled affections and a reformed workplace, blending brisk dialogue, workplace farce, and a gentle affirmation of a woman’s professional capability and romantic worth.",
