  "descriptions": "Dorian, a successful New York cartoonist known for his sardonic humor, is ready to turn his whimsical sketches into a real family. He marries Meg, an ambitious food critic whose precise, controlled life contrasts his creative spontaneity. Their shared dream of having a child becomes the axis of their marriage, but as fertility struggles mount—miscarriages, invasive treatments, and mounting pressure—the warmth between them cools into routine, resentment, and awkward silence. Dorian copes by chasing jokes; Meg copes by chasing perfection. Neither finds the comfort they need in the other.\n\nDuring a separation meant to give them space, Dorian meets a younger, free-spirited woman, a singer who seems to embody everything effortless and alive. With her, parenthood suddenly seems possible without spreadsheets and syringes, and Dorian is thrust into a confusing swirl of guilt, hope, and midlife reinvention. He toggles between two loves and two visions of fatherhood: one born of long-term commitment and grief, the other of impulsive chemistry and second chances.\n\nAs fate complicates both relationships—unexpected pregnancies, miscarried expectations, and shifting loyalties—Dorian starts realizing that love cannot be engineered like a punchline. The film follows his increasingly comic, sometimes painful attempts to reconcile his yearning for a child with the reality of adult relationships, where timing and trust matter as much as biology.\n\nIn the end, Dorian learns that what’s “funny about love” isn’t the jokes but the way it survives disappointment. He faces the consequences of his choices, seeking a path that honors both the family he wanted and the people he’s hurt, finally sketching a future that’s messier, braver, and real.",
