  "descriptions": "Khumba (2013) is an animated adventure about a young zebra born with only half his stripes, which makes him an outcast in his superstitious herd. When a severe drought hits their enclosure in the Great Karoo, the others blame Khumba’s unusual appearance for their misfortune. Feeling responsible and eager to belong, Khumba sets off to find a mythical waterhole said to grant a zebra its missing stripes.\n\nGuided by a map and tales from a mystical mantis, Khumba leaves the safety of his fenced reserve and ventures into the wider, perilous desert. Along the way, he befriends two unlikely companions: Phango, a dramatic wildebeest named Mama V, and Bradley, a neurotic ostrich with big dreams. Together they cross harsh landscapes, encounter eccentric animals, and learn to rely on one another.\n\nTheir journey is shadowed by an infamous, half-blind leopard named Phango who believes that consuming Khumba will fulfill a prophecy and make him the ultimate predator. As Khumba follows clues toward the legendary waterhole—rumored to lie where the sun meets the earth—he confronts dust storms, cliffs, and the realization that the quest for stripes may be less about his appearance and more about his identity.\n\nIn the climax, Phango attacks the herd after luring them into a canyon. Khumba returns to defend his family, using his agility and the environment to outsmart the leopard. By defeating Phango and opening a path to water, Khumba proves his worth. He learns that stripes don’t define courage or belonging; his uniqueness is a strength rather than a flaw.\n\nThe herd finally accepts Khumba for who he is, and the drought ends as water flows back into their land. Khumba embraces his half-striped coat, symbolizing that true identity comes from deeds and heart, not from outward markings.",
