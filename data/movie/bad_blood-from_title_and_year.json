  "descriptions": "In a quiet New Zealand town in 2010, an estranged family is forced back together when a violent crime dredges up long-buried secrets. Jacob, a reformed ex-con trying to rebuild his life as a mechanic, is pulled into chaos after his hot-headed younger brother, Tom, becomes entangled with a local meth syndicate. When a deal goes bad, a man ends up dead and Tom disappears, leaving Jacob to navigate a maze of lies to save him.\n\nDetective Sarah Keely, an uncompromising investigator with her own troubled past, suspects the brothers are hiding more than they admit. As she tightens the noose, Jacob uncovers that the syndicate’s quiet reach extends to a respected businessman who once employed their abusive father. Old wounds reopen: the brothers’ childhood marred by violence, a mother who sacrificed everything to keep them safe, and a legacy of anger that shaped who they became.\n\nJacob strikes a dangerous bargain with the syndicate to buy Tom time, only to learn Tom’s panicked actions have set off a vendetta. The brothers must choose between running or confronting the truth. In a tense showdown at an isolated coastal cannery, betrayals are revealed: an associate flips, Keely arrives with a risky plan, and the syndicate turns on itself. Jacob sacrifices his freedom to shield Tom, forcing a reckoning that collapses the criminal network but leaves him facing prison.\n\nKeely, recognizing Jacob’s desperate attempt at redemption, ensures the truth is recorded. The film closes on Tom waiting outside a correctional facility, sober and determined, as the tide recedes. The family curse may not be broken, but the cycle of bad blood finally shows a crack.",
