  "descriptions": "Children of the Corn III: Urban Harvest (1995) transports the sinister rural mythology of the series into a gritty Chicago setting. After the violent death of their abusive father in a Nebraska cornfield, two orphaned brothers—Joshua and Eli—are taken in by a well-meaning but opportunistic Chicago couple, William and Amanda Porter. William, a commodities trader, sees potential profit in Eli’s strange, drought-defying corn seeds, while Amanda hopes to build a family. The brothers attempt to adapt to city life, with older, streetwise Joshua fitting in at school and making friends, while Eli remains eerily devout, aloof, and protective of a mysterious Bible wrapped in black cloth.\n\nEli secretly plants his supernatural corn in an abandoned lot behind an inner-city church and soon revives the cult of “He Who Walks Behind the Rows,” the demonic entity worshiped by the Gatlin children in the earlier films. Targeting disaffected and bullied urban teens, Eli sermons with firebrand zeal, transforming normal adolescent frustration into fanatical devotion. As the corn grows unnaturally fast—lush, towering, and pulsating with malevolence—it begins to exert a hypnotic influence over the new flock.\n\nJoshua grows uneasy as those who cross Eli suffer grisly fates. Eli exerts psychic and ritual power, weaponizing both his scripture and the corn to silence skeptics. A social worker’s investigation uncovers that Eli hasn’t aged in decades and bears a link to the original Nebraska cult; he is not just a survivor but a conduit for the entity’s will. When she tries to intervene, she becomes another victim of the corn’s hunger. Joshua’s bond with his new friend and a sympathetic girl at school grounds him, but his loyalty to Eli is tested by increasingly overt horrors.\n\nWilliam, sensing a financial windfall, partners with an agribusiness firm to mass-produce Eli’s miracle corn. As samples are shipped, the film teases a looming, large-scale contamination of the food supply. Meanwhile, the church becomes a battleground: Eli usurps religious authority, twisting scripture for sacrifice while his crop infiltrates the nave, tendrils pushing through tiles and walls. The city setting amplifies the danger; what was once a remote, rural cult is now positioned to spread through supply chains and urban congregations alike.\n\nJoshua discovers that Eli’s power is anchored in his black scripture, a demonic Bible that renews his unholy covenant. In a desperate bid to save those around him, Joshua steals and burns the book. This act weakens Eli, fracturing his hold over the teens and drawing out the true form of He Who Walks Behind the Rows. In a climactic sequence, the entity manifests as a monstrous, root-and-flesh abomination bursting from the cornfield that has overtaken the churchyard. Chaos erupts: pews splinter, stained glass explodes, and writhing stalks ensnare victims as the demon attempts to devour Joshua and reclaim Eli’s dominion.\n\nWith the cult in disarray and the creature vulnerable, Joshua fights to destroy the source of its power. Fire becomes both symbol and weapon; the infernal harvest that empowered the cult now becomes its undoing. Joshua’s courage and the destruction of Eli’s scripture sever the pact, causing the demon to collapse in a maelstrom of burning husks and collapsing roots. The surviving teens stagger away, freed from the malign influence.\n\nThe film closes on an ominous coda: despite the apparent victory, William’s business deal means that Eli’s corn has already been distributed. The final images suggest the seeds of corruption have been sown far beyond Chicago, hinting that He Who Walks Behind the Rows may yet return wherever the cursed harvest takes root.",
